          <h3>Here's a brief timeline of Nikola Tesla's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1856</strong> - Born on July 10 in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia).</li>
            <li><strong>1875</strong> - Enrolled at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz to study electrical engineering.</li>
            <li><strong>1881</strong> - Started working for the Continental Edison Company in France.</li>
            <li><strong>1884</strong> - Arrived in New York City and started working for Thomas Edison.</li>
            <li><strong>1887</strong> - Developed the induction motor and AC power transmission system.</li>
            <li><strong>1891</strong> - Constructed the Tesla coil, a high-voltage resonant transformer circuit.</li>
            <li><strong>1893</strong> - Powering the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Tesla demonstrated the feasibility and safety of transmitting electrical power without wires.</li>
            <li><strong>1896</strong> - Conducted experiments in Colorado Springs, exploring wireless power transmission and investigating atmospheric electricity.</li>
            <li><strong>1901</strong> - Began construction of the Wardenclyffe Tower, intended to be a wireless communication and power transmission station.</li>
            <li><strong>1943</strong> - Passed away on January 7 in New York City at the age of 86.</li>
          </ul>

            <p>"The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>"The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine."</p>
